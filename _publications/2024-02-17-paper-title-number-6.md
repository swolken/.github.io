excerpt: "With [Marc Jacobs](https://www.marc-s-jacob.com/), [Sean Westwood](https://polarizationresearchlab.org/sean-j-westwood/), and [Yphtach Lelkes](https://www.ylelkes.com/). Commentators have regularly noted the increasing involvement of evangelical movements in American politics. Despite this consensus, there is limited understanding of how evangelical leaders engage with politics within their congregations and potentially shape their congregants' political views. To examine the prevalence and content of political speech in evangelical communities, we construct a dataset of approximately 50,000 sermon recordings around the 2022 midterm elections. We employ large language models (LLMs) to identify policy discussion and vote instructions in transcribed sermons. Our findings reveal that political references in evangelical sermons are frequent, especially around elections. By contrast, direct endorsements of political candidates remain rare, suggesting a maintained division between church and state, with political discourse in evangelical churches focusing on social issues rather than specific candidates."
