excerpt: "Today's media environment provides Americans with unparalleled choice in how or whether to watch political TV news. Prior studies have focused on the impacts of the growing range of ideological slants on vote choice. But the fragmentation of the media landscape may also increase variation in the coverage of race-related topics. With a large audience and programs that even some employees thought conveyed racism, Fox News provides a valuable case study. We use a population-based panel 2008--2020 to measure the associations between changes in self-reported Fox News viewership and race-related attitudes and thus bound Fox News' likely effects assuming positive selection. Difference-in-difference models demonstrate that increased Fox News watching is not strongly associated with increases in Whites' anti-Black prejudice or opposition to government assistance targeting Black Americans. However, those whose Fox News watching increased grew increasingly anti-immigration. These results indicate the limits of Fox News' impacts on racial prejudice."
