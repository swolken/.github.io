excerpt: 'Automated text annotation is a compelling use case for generative large language models (LLMs) in social media re-search. Recent work suggests that LLMs can achieve strongperformance on annotation tasks; however, these studies evaluate LLMs on a small number of tasks and likely suffer from contamination due to a reliance on public benchmark datasets. Here, we test a human-centered frameworkfor responsibly evaluating artificial intelligence tools usedin automated annotation. We use GPT-4 to replicate 27 annotation tasks across 11 password-protected datasets fromrecently published computational social science articles in high-impact journals. For each task, we compare GPT-4 an-notations against human-annotated ground-truth labels andagainst annotations from separate supervised classificationmodels fine-tuned on human-generated labels. Although thequality of LLM labels is generally high, we find significant variation in LLM performance across tasks, even withindatasets. Our findings underscore the importance of a human-centered workflow and careful evaluation standards: Automated annotations significantly diverge from human judgment in numerous scenarios, despite various optimizationstrategies such as prompt tuning. Grounding automated annotation in validation labels generated by humans is essentialfor responsible evaluation.'
