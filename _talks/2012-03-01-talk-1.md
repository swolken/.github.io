I spoke at the (Political and Information Networks Workshop)[https://css.seas.upenn.edu/homa-hosseinmardi-and-sam-wolken-speak-at-annenberg-workshop/], hosted by the University of Pennsylvania, about the role of LLMs in computational social science research. I argued it is a critical time to implement rigorous standards for validation.
