I'm Sam Wolken, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania jointly in Political Science and Communication. I received a Master's degree from The Wharton School in Statistics and Data Science in 2023. I use computational tools to study the information environment. I consider how market forces shape news production and, in turn, how the media influences the way Americans think about and engage with politics and government. My dissertation focuses on local television news: what's on it, who watches it, and whether viewers change their habits when local newscasts turn nationalized and partisan. I also research how social scientists can integrate AI tools into their research reliably and effectively, such as generative AI for text annotation and multimodal models for audio and video data.
