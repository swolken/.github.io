I'm Sam Wolken, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania jointly in Political Science and Communication. I received a Master's degree from The Wharton School in Statistics and Data Science in 2023. I use computational tools to study information environments. I consider how market forces shape news production and, in turn, how the media influences the way Americans think about and engage with politics and government. My dissertation focuses on local television news: what's on it, who watches it, and how consumers respond to the appearance of partisan commentary on local newscasts.
